<h2>
    Responsive Website Tutorial
</h2>
<p>
    Responsive Website with HTML, CSS, Flexbox, CSS Grid &amp; More by <strong>Traversy Media</strong>
    
    This is a duplicate website of what Brad did in his tutorial. The code is not mine, I just followed along with the video so I could understand the topic more.
        
    Some things that I added/changed:
    <ul>
        <li>Changed the title names throughout the website</li>
        <li>Changed the form's responsiveness for smaller displays</li>
        <li>Added a favicon</li>
    </ul>
