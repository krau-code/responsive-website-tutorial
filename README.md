## Responsive Website Tutorial

Responsive Website with HTML, CSS, Flexbox, CSS Grid &amp; More by *Traversy Media*

This is a duplicate website of what Brad did in his tutorial. The code is not mine, I just followed along with the video so I could understand the topic more.

Some things that I added/changed:
* Changed title names throughout the website
* Changed the form's responsiveness for smaller devices
* Added a favicon
